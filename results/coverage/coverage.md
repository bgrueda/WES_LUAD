### Coverage

This files are a complement to the depth files. And we could observe how uniform are the reads distributed according to the reference genome.   
We expect an uniform distribution, as well as posible, in therms of having better representation.  
We should not forgive that with this kind of parameters we could have a first identification of possible structural variants.
